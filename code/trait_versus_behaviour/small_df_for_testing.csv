100,m-euroculture,"The study programme

Euroculture is a two-year master's programme that offers specialized knowledge and methodological and social competence which help students to work in a problem- and project-oriented way even beyond the usual subject-specific limitations, and to present the results in an adequate manner. The MA supports students in familiarizing with the methodology of interdisciplinary research and offers in-depth understanding of political, sociological, historical, or cultural-scientific point of view. Our students will – at the end of their studies – be able to analyse European integration processes in an independent, interdisciplinary and problem-oriented way and to judge the effects that regional, national and supranational cooperation and conflicts of the past have on current developments and the dynamics in Europe.

Euroculture - Society, Politics and Culture in a Global Context is unique because it offers a joint, integrated programme run in a Consortium of twelve renown universities on four continents. By studying at a minimum of two universities and by undergoing an internship or a research track, our students decide which pathway they take through the programme and we, teachers and coordinators, accompany them through this journey by offering support and advice. This is one reason for why we have a success rate of 98%.
International and intercultural experience

With an interdisciplinary approach that combines courses from at least two leading European universities with an internship and hands-on skills training, Euroculture prepares you to make a difference in careers like diplomacy, international business, research, journalism, cultural management, and European administration. Moreover, the MA´s compulsory mobility track and it´s various applicants from all over the world, help students to dive into an international and intercultural experience.

Studying at at least two universities gives the possibility to students to improve their ability to communicate interculturally and to therefore improve their knowledge of foreign languages. Moreover, the MA Euroculture teaches students how to conduct scientific work independently, how to adapt to different work and life environments and how take responsibility and leadership in groups consisting of members from different national and cultural backgrounds.
Career & Alumni

The Euroculture programme gives students a chance to prepare themselves to enter new professions that come into being due to the intensifying process of economic and political integration in Europe. Euroculture serves to qualify graduates to take up professions that require sound knowledge of European culture, current transnational developments in European society and politics in a global context, and the European integration process. Some of the possible professions are work with European institutions and organisations, with institutions of teaching, research and further education, the media and journalism, librarianship, foundations and associations, culture management, museums and collections, tourism, foreigner and migrant counselling, public relations, and human resource management (especially in international companies).

The most recent Euroculture Alumni Report has shown that Euroculture graduates find their first relevant job in no time: 70% secure a job within the first 3 months after graduation, and the rest mostly within 6 months after graduation. This is a very positive result, that shows how well the programme equips its students with skills necessary for the job market. Especially such practical courses like Project Management, and the experience our students acquire working in international teams help the Euroculture alumni be successful.",f,"{'masculine_coded_words': ['competence', 'analyse', 'independent', 'decide', 'leading', 'independently', 'leadership'], 'feminine_coded_words': ['supports', 'understanding', 'cooperation', 'support', 'responsibility']}"
101,m-art-history,"Programme description

Based on the skills acquired in the Bachelor's programme, the M.A. programme in Art History expands and deepens the methodological repertoire as well as the knowledge of objects with regard to technique, genre and epoch of their creation as well as reception. Various study options are offered for this purpose (for details, see the chapter on study structure):

 Single Honours MA in Art History with study focus „curatorial studies (78 C)
 Joint Honours MA in Art History (42 C)
 Joint Honours MA (42 C) with study focus curatorial studies
 Module package Art History (36 C / 18 C) in combination with a Joint Honours MA in another subject

The M.A. programme in Art History with the specialisation Curatorial Studies combines the practice of practical ways of dealing with originals with reflection on the theory and history of artistic objects. This includes collecting and dealing with works of art as well as museum and other forms of presentation. In four semesters, students acquire the relevant knowledge and skills and are qualified to work with works of art using originals from the Göttingen University Art Collection, but also through supplementary work-related internships outside Göttingen University. At the same time, students also acquire the historical-theoretical knowledge required for a scientifically reflective approach to these objects. The specialisation is aimed at students with a B.A. degree in art history, art studies, visual studies or a related discipline.
Research and study focus in Göttingen

In Göttingen, art history is taught in its entire historical and thematic breadth. Special emphasis is placed on the art history of the Middle Ages and the early modern period in Italy, the visual arts of the 19th century and modernity, historical theories of images and art, transcultural interconnections and modern artistic knowledge. Another focus of teaching is the materiality of knowledge.

A special feature of the Göttingen Institute is the curatorial training in the art collection, which ranges from teaching on the objects to developing one's own exhibitions. Göttingen University has one of the few university art collections in Germany with valuable holdings from the Middle Ages to the present. Around 2,500 hand drawings, 15,000 sheets of prints, 300 paintings, numerous sculptures, a photo and a video art collection reflect the artistic production of several centuries. Students in Göttingen learn how to handle original works of art from the very beginning of their studies and gain lasting experience for their professional practice in art history. Project seminars are held regularly and research during studies is one of our great strengths. The students prepare exhibitions themselves and publish the results of their research in high-quality exhibition catalogues. There are permanent cooperations in teaching with the Landesmuseum Hannover, the HAWK Hildesheim (conservation and restoration course), the Herzog-Anton-Ulrich-Museum in Braunschweig, the Museumslandschaft Hessen-Kassel and the Lower Saxony Department of Monument Preservation.

The study programme also includes regular excursions at home and abroad as well as stays abroad at European partner universities.

In Göttingen, the Department of Art History works closely with the university collections, the Institute for Digital Humanities, various research institutions on campus and the Forum Wissen. Within the Dpartment of Art History, there are particularly close collaborations with the object-based, historical and cultural studies subjects.
Occupational fields

The Master's programme in Art History prepares students for a broad professional field. This includes work in museums, in the preservation of historical monuments and in universities, but also in galleries, in the art trade, in tourism, in publishing houses, newspapers, media institutions, insurance companies and in all areas of cultural management. In the specialisation Curatorial Studies, graduates are especially introduced to working at museums and collections of classical and modern art at home and abroad, in the art trade, galleries and auction houses. The degree programme also qualifies students for an academic career at universities and non-university research institutions in the subject and - beyond the professional fields mentioned - is also an entry requirement for the doctoral programme in art history.",f,"{'masculine_coded_words': [], 'feminine_coded_words': ['cooperations']}"
