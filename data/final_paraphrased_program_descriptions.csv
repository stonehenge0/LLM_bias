100,m-euroculture,"The study programme

Euroculture is a two-year master's programme that offers specialized knowledge and methodological and social competence which help students to work in a problem- and project-oriented way even beyond the usual subject-specific limitations, and to present the results in an adequate manner. The MA supports students in familiarizing with the methodology of interdisciplinary research and offers in-depth understanding of political, sociological, historical, or cultural-scientific point of view. Our students will – at the end of their studies – be able to analyse European integration processes in an independent, interdisciplinary and problem-oriented way and to judge the effects that regional, national and supranational cooperation and conflicts of the past have on current developments and the dynamics in Europe.

Euroculture - Society, Politics and Culture in a Global Context is unique because it offers a joint, integrated programme run in a Consortium of twelve renown universities on four continents. By studying at a minimum of two universities and by undergoing an internship or a research track, our students decide which pathway they take through the programme and we, teachers and coordinators, accompany them through this journey by offering support and advice. This is one reason for why we have a success rate of 98%.
International and intercultural experience

With an interdisciplinary approach that combines courses from at least two leading European universities with an internship and hands-on skills training, Euroculture prepares you to make a difference in careers like diplomacy, international business, research, journalism, cultural management, and European administration. Moreover, the MA´s compulsory mobility track and it´s various applicants from all over the world, help students to dive into an international and intercultural experience.

Studying at at least two universities gives the possibility to students to improve their ability to communicate interculturally and to therefore improve their knowledge of foreign languages. Moreover, the MA Euroculture teaches students how to conduct scientific work independently, how to adapt to different work and life environments and how take responsibility and leadership in groups consisting of members from different national and cultural backgrounds.
Career & Alumni

The Euroculture programme gives students a chance to prepare themselves to enter new professions that come into being due to the intensifying process of economic and political integration in Europe. Euroculture serves to qualify graduates to take up professions that require sound knowledge of European culture, current transnational developments in European society and politics in a global context, and the European integration process. Some of the possible professions are work with European institutions and organisations, with institutions of teaching, research and further education, the media and journalism, librarianship, foundations and associations, culture management, museums and collections, tourism, foreigner and migrant counselling, public relations, and human resource management (especially in international companies).

The most recent Euroculture Alumni Report has shown that Euroculture graduates find their first relevant job in no time: 70% secure a job within the first 3 months after graduation, and the rest mostly within 6 months after graduation. This is a very positive result, that shows how well the programme equips its students with skills necessary for the job market. Especially such practical courses like Project Management, and the experience our students acquire working in international teams help the Euroculture alumni be successful.",f,"{

101,m-art-history,"Programme description

Based on the skills acquired in the Bachelor's programme, the M.A. programme in Art History expands and deepens the methodological repertoire as well as the knowledge of objects with regard to technique, genre and epoch of their creation as well as reception. Various study options are offered for this purpose (for details, see the chapter on study structure):

 Single Honours MA in Art History with study focus „curatorial studies (78 C)
 Joint Honours MA in Art History (42 C)
 Joint Honours MA (42 C) with study focus curatorial studies
 Module package Art History (36 C / 18 C) in combination with a Joint Honours MA in another subject

The M.A. programme in Art History with the specialisation Curatorial Studies combines the practice of practical ways of dealing with originals with reflection on the theory and history of artistic objects. This includes collecting and dealing with works of art as well as museum and other forms of presentation. In four semesters, students acquire the relevant knowledge and skills and are qualified to work with works of art using originals from the Göttingen University Art Collection, but also through supplementary work-related internships outside Göttingen University. At the same time, students also acquire the historical-theoretical knowledge required for a scientifically reflective approach to these objects. The specialisation is aimed at students with a B.A. degree in art history, art studies, visual studies or a related discipline.
Research and study focus in Göttingen

In Göttingen, art history is taught in its entire historical and thematic breadth. Special emphasis is placed on the art history of the Middle Ages and the early modern period in Italy, the visual arts of the 19th century and modernity, historical theories of images and art, transcultural interconnections and modern artistic knowledge. Another focus of teaching is the materiality of knowledge.

A special feature of the Göttingen Institute is the curatorial training in the art collection, which ranges from teaching on the objects to developing one's own exhibitions. Göttingen University has one of the few university art collections in Germany with valuable holdings from the Middle Ages to the present. Around 2,500 hand drawings, 15,000 sheets of prints, 300 paintings, numerous sculptures, a photo and a video art collection reflect the artistic production of several centuries. Students in Göttingen learn how to handle original works of art from the very beginning of their studies and gain lasting experience for their professional practice in art history. Project seminars are held regularly and research during studies is one of our great strengths. The students prepare exhibitions themselves and publish the results of their research in high-quality exhibition catalogues. There are permanent cooperations in teaching with the Landesmuseum Hannover, the HAWK Hildesheim (conservation and restoration course), the Herzog-Anton-Ulrich-Museum in Braunschweig, the Museumslandschaft Hessen-Kassel and the Lower Saxony Department of Monument Preservation.

The study programme also includes regular excursions at home and abroad as well as stays abroad at European partner universities.

In Göttingen, the Department of Art History works closely with the university collections, the Institute for Digital Humanities, various research institutions on campus and the Forum Wissen. Within the Dpartment of Art History, there are particularly close collaborations with the object-based, historical and cultural studies subjects.
Occupational fields

The Master's programme in Art History prepares students for a broad professional field. This includes work in museums, in the preservation of historical monuments and in universities, but also in galleries, in the art trade, in tourism, in publishing houses, newspapers, media institutions, insurance companies and in all areas of cultural management. In the specialisation Curatorial Studies, graduates are especially introduced to working at museums and collections of classical and modern art at home and abroad, in the art trade, galleries and auction houses. The degree programme also qualifies students for an academic career at universities and non-university research institutions in the subject and - beyond the professional fields mentioned - is also an entry requirement for the doctoral programme in art history.",f,"{

107,b-business-informatics,"General information: What is it all about?

As an interdisciplinary subject, the business information systems degree programme is composed of economic content, primarily business administration, informatics content, and additional business informatics content. Information management, system development and system selection as well as (business) application systems, for example, are fundamental subfields of the business information systems degree programme. In your studies, you will deal with topics such as the design of application systems, mobile applications, data management and machine learning. The generous elective area gives you the opportunity to get to know many different subject areas in order to discover new interests - also through modules outside of business informatics and economics.

You must be able to apply your knowledge in reality. Therefore, all modules are designed to establish a link to practice and to smooth your transition into professional life in the fast-moving IT industries through up-to-date content. In the project seminar on system development, you will design and accompany - also in cooperation with practical partners from the business world - the complete development of a software solution.

In hardly any other industry does the relevant knowledge change as quickly as in IT. We prepare you optimally for this dynamic professional field: On the one hand, we teach you practical and cutting-edge content and, on the other hand, timeless methods that will help you to familiarise yourself with new tasks throughout your entire professional life.

The programme is completely modularised, i.e. credits are acquired during studies. The programme is successfully completed when 180 credits have been earned.

Prerequisites/ Personal skills

For a qualified bachelor's programme in the field of economics, students must especially have sound knowledge in the English language (international students also must have good German language skills), mathematics as well as information and communications systems (ICS).

Students whose knowledge of English/ German, mathematics or ICS is poor are strongly suggested to improve in these areas before beginning with the programme. The Faculty of Business and Economics also offers a precourse in Mathematics for new students to prepare them for the following modules in Mathematics (every winter and summer semester).
Selection procedure and admission criteria

Admission to the Bachelor's degree programme in Business Information Systems is restricted in the first subject-related semester, while the higher subject-related semesters are not subject to admission restrictions. Students can apply and be enrolled in both the summer and winter semesters.

What we expect from you:

 Motivation and a will to achieve
 Interest in entrepreneurial or macroeconomic issues
 Analytical thinking faculties as well as an interest in and ability to deal with mathematical methods of presentation
 Good proficiency in German, a good or at least working knowledge of the English language

Career perspectives

As a graduate with a bachelor degree, you will have career opportunities in a multitude of professions. The labour market continues to be characterised by a strong demand for highly qualified information technology (IT) specialists.

Core occupations for graduates of the Bachelor's programme in Business Information Systems include jobs as computer specialists and system analysts. Bachelor degree graduates will be tasked with planning, documenting and rolling out hardware and software and gathering data on the impacts on organisational forms. This additionally involves support in solving problems and the modification or new development of concepts. Concrete jobs for graduates with a bachelor degree include jobs as specialists at computing centres and user services, organisation and system analysts, advisors and vendors or software developers as well as work implementing and modifying standard software for business administration applications (for example SAP).

Moreover, bachelor degree holders can work in hybrid occupations as so-called hybrid experts, i.e. individuals who are familiar with business problems and are capable of designing IT solutions. These individuals are often employed in a coordinating function between the operating department and the IT department. Project managers, project coordinators and system analysts are some examples of specific professions. Fields that graduates can work in include either those (1) within the data processing (DP) department (for example, system analysis, user consulting, DP control) or (2) outside the DP department in business-oriented operational departments with distinct DP references, such as organisation.

110,b-philosophy,"Subject description

Philosophy deals with the fundamental question of theoretical world interpretation and practical formation of life. It examines aspects that can be clarified through methodical contemplation. In order to do so, the ability to logically analyse abstract theoretical problems as well as to argument logically correctly must be acquired. The course of study comprises systematic parts (theoretical and practical philosophy) as well as historical (history of philosophy). Disciplines belonging to theoretical philosophy are epistemology, scientific theory, philosophy of language, philosophy of mind as well as aesthetics. Practical parts include, among others, ethics, political philosophy, law and social philosophy. The historical part is studied using selected texts of classic philosophic authors and based on philosophical-historical epochs.

Studies in the two-subject bachelor's programme aim to make the students appropriately comprehend problems and conceptions of philosophy, deal with them scientifically and to communicate their basic principles in a manner understandable to all. The graduates should especially have the skills to appropriately use the scientific aids of the study of philosophy, to understand and apply methods of philosophical thought and argumentation, to understand and classify philosophical texts in their historical interpretation and systematic connection, deal with philosophical problems of intermediate difficulty in written and oral form with precise terminology, and to weigh arguments against each other in an appropriate manner",n,"{

111,b-musicology,"What does musicology do?                                                                  
                                                                
Music is not just something people listen to or do: it is also something people study. Musicology is the science of music: it is about finding out what music actually is, how it works, and what it means to people. And it is about fundamentally thinking about what we can learn about people, their culture, their history(s) and their webs of relationships through music.                                
Musicology views music as a human practice that has a wide variety of forms and meanings through the diversity of the world's cultures and historical change. At the Göttingen Department of Musicology, we are convinced that there is not one music, but many musics. Music can be studied in many manifestations: as a communicative expression, as a system of knowledge, as part of cultural action and cultural identity. Music can be analysed as a work of art or as a function of a social network within a society. Music can be used as a medium for feelings, ideas and self-understandings, or as an instrument of (powerlessness) power.
                                
This plurality is also reflected in the means of researching music. The focus here is on thinking about music as well as thinking through music and sound, for which we have the following repertoires of methods at our disposal:
                                 
Historical research (evaluation of written, sound and visual sources)
field research (participant observation of music practices)
Hearing analysis, musical text analysis
Analysis of sound as a mode of knowledge
Computer-assisted analysis (e.g. spectral or frequency analysis)

Completion of a Bachelor's degree in Musicology will qualify you for a great variety of occupations in culture management and politics, in the area of the media and public relations, at theatres, in the library sector and related areas. The Bachelor's degree in the subject of Musicology can serve, in particular, as the basis for a Master's degree programme in Musicology or a related subject.

They are introduced to Greek, Roman and Byzantine culture and ancient history through introductory lectures and tutorials. The degree programme takes into account the current academic trend towards cultural anthropological questions and interdisciplinary field research. This is achieved by means of integrative cultural-comparative courses in cooperation with neighbouring disciplines as well as high practical components. You can take internal and external practical courses, for example in excavation technology, surveying technology, drawing and photographic object documentation, digital image processing, ceramic analysis and restoration, moulding techniques, museology, monument preservation, archaeological science journalism with the corresponding career-qualifying perspectives.
                                        
Examination results are usually achieved by giving presentations and writing assignments. In this way, you will thoroughly learn how to work scientifically and acquire numerous additional competences:
                                        
Targeted research of information,
Evaluation of the information and argumentation based on it,
Presentation of the results achieved, i.e. the ability to express oneself verbally, visually and in writing.
                                        
The Archaeological Institute's networks at home and abroad allow you mobility (e.g. Erasmus) already in the Bachelor's programme.
                                        
In addition, the students are thus well prepared for writing their final thesis and actively shape their courses through the presentations.
                                
subject area and research foci
                                        
Basically, two subjects are combined in one degree programme! Classical Archaeology deals with earlier antiquity, Christian Archaeology/Byzantine Art History with later antiquity. They therefore build on each other. The Bachelor's degree programme makes use of the common methodological foundations as well as overlaps in content. In addition, students gain an insight into the various research foci of the lecturers (e.g. political and religious iconography, stylistic analysis, cultural contacts, gender, architecture, landscape, liturgy).
                                        
The Archaeological Institute in Göttingen offers you excellent libraries and, above all, 250-year-old collections of ancient originals, casts of ancient sculptures and coins. They are continuously used in the courses. Already in early semesters, students come into direct contact with archaeological material. The institute's restoration workshop offers students important practice. There are cooperations with the museums in Kassel, Hanover and Frankfurt. Internships can be completed there during the practical part of the programme. Numerous field research projects in Italy, Greece and Spain also offer favourable conditions for quickly gaining practical archaeological experience.
                                        
The multifaceted study of archaeology in Göttingen creates the best opportunities for training and research, especially in the fields of ancient sculpture and iconography, architecture, historical regional studies, numismatics and the reception of antiquity.
                                
occupational fields
The programme conveys knowledge as well as methodical and practical skills, enabling graduates to qualify for occupations in the fields of youth and adult education, culture management, tourism, publishing houses, the press, new media, diplomatic institutions, international organisations, etc. Graduates also have the possibility to continue their studies in a Master's programme to prepare themselves for a scientific career path in fields related to museums, the conservation of ancient monuments, universities as well as non-university research institutions.",n,"{

114,m-forest-science,"Programme description

Study contents provide hands-on approaches to tackle burning current issues such as global change, climate warming, land use change, species loss and biodiversity treats. The studies cover ecosystems analysis and modelling with in-dept training in advanced programming, data analysis as well as theoretical ecology and practical conservation management. Research-based training on terrestrial ecosystems function from molecules to landscape level and laboratory methods in ecosystems sciences and sustainable management of tropical and international forests where students together prepare an interdisciplinary management plan on-site. Throughout their studies, students will take part in cutting- edge research activities on these topics in an interdisciplinary and international environment.
Goals

In the Master Programme the students specialise in a field of choice. There are three specialization fields (programmes) the students can choose from:

    Ecosystem Analysis and Modelling
    Ecosystem Sciences
    Tropical and International Forestry

The specialisations convey scientific contents and methods as well as professional skills for subsequent occupational activity. These skills comprise competences in problem solving, capacity for teamwork, know how with project management and interdisciplinary thinking and working.
Content

Study contents are quite different, depending on the specialization field. In addition to the programme-specific compulsory courses a number of optional courses, covering 30 credit points, can be selected from course offerings by the Faculty of Forestry, by other faculties of the University of Göttingen and from international partner universities.
Specialization: Ecosystem Analysis and Modelling

    By understanding methods of ecosystem analysis and modelling, students will be able to analyze complex systems, e.g., regarding the consequences of climate change and of new ecosystem regulation and management practices. This includes competence in problem solving by simulation and statistical modelling, as well as in presenting results using latest media formats. These quantitative skills are applied to analyze ecosystems with a focus on forest ecosystems.
    The topics in the compulsory courses include: Introduction to ecological modelling; ecosystem theory, including analysis of structures and processes; biodiversity; macro-ecology and biogeography; soil sciences and bioclimatology, conservation; methods from computer science; individual- and agent-based modelling; advanced statistical data analysis with R; functional-structural simulation modelling; spatial modelling.

Specialization: Ecosystem Sciences

    Terrestrial ecosystems provide essential functions and services to society. Understanding and maintaining these complex functions in the light of global change are some of the greatest challenges humanity is facing. Students of the M.Sc. focus Ecosystem Sciences will gain critical thinking skills, learn modern concepts as well as latest field and laboratory methods and get a strong quantitative training in theory, measurement and application.
    The interdisciplinary program is part of the Faculty of Forest Sciences and Forest Ecology, however students have the unique possibility to specialize in many subjects that cross traditional disciplines.
